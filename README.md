# Chrome Extension to create or edit vector graphics such as illustrations, diagrams, line arts, charts, logos and complex paintings
========================

Chrome Extension from http://www.offidocs.com to create or edit vector graphics such as illustrations, diagrams, line arts, charts, logos and complex paintings. It is an integration with the Linux Desktop app Inkscape, which is an open-source vector graphics editor similar to Adobe Illustrator, Corel Draw, Freehand, or Xara X. What sets Inkscape apart is its use of Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG), an open XML-based W3C standard, as the native format.

Inkscape features are:

Object creation
- Drawing: pencil tool (freehand drawing with simple paths), pen tool (creating BÃ©zier curves and straight lines), calligraphy tool (freehand drawing using filled paths representing calligraphic strokes)
- Shape tools: rectangles (may have rounded corners), ellipses (includes circles, arcs, segments), stars/polygons (can be rounded and/or randomized), spirals
- Text tool (multi-line text, full on-canvas editing)

Object manipulation
- Transformations (moving, scaling, rotating, skewing), both interactively and by specifying exact numeric values
- Grouping objects ("select in group" without ungrouping, or "enter the group" making it a temporary layer)
- Layers (lock and/or hide individual layers, rearrange them, etc; layers can form a hierarchical tree)

Alignment and distribution
- Fill and stroke
- Color selector (RGB, HSL, CMYK, color wheel, CMS)
- Color picker tool
- Copy/paste style
- A gradient editor capable of multi-stop gradients
- Pattern fills (bitmap/vectors)
- Dashed strokes, with many predefined dash patterns
- Path markers (ending, middle and/or beginning marks, e.g. arrowheads)

Text support
- Multi-line text
- Kerning, letterspacing, linespacing adjustments
- Text on path (both text and path remain editable)
- Alpha transparency support for display and PNG export

File formats
- Perfectly compliant SVG format file generation and editing
- Live watching and editing the document tree in the XML editor
- PNG, OpenDocument Drawing, DXF, sk1, PDF, EPS and PostScript export formats and more
